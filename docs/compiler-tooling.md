description: Inspect, validate, render, and diff Clean IoC's compiled dependency graph in Python or CI.

# Compiler tooling

Clean IoC exposes the compiled dependency graph as a build artifact. Mark application entry points to focus the default
tooling view, then inspect the component plans used by runtime resolution.

```python
from clean_ioc import ContainerBuilder

builder = ContainerBuilder()
builder.register(PaymentGateway, StripeGateway)
builder.register(Checkout)
builder.mark_entrypoint(Checkout)

container = builder.build()
print(container.build_report.to_text())
print(container.graph.to_text())
```

An entry point changes the default tooling view, not compilation or resolution. Clean IoC still compiles and validates every visible root, and an unmarked root remains resolvable. Once any entry point is marked, registrations outside all marked component trees produce `unreachable-component` warnings.

Mark a collection when every implementation is an application entry point:

```python
builder.mark_entrypoint(list[MessageHandler])
```

## Structured build reports

A successful runtime exposes its immutable `BuildReport` as `container.build_report`. A failed build raises `ContainerBuildError` with the same report on `error.report`.

```python
from clean_ioc import ContainerBuildError

try:
    container = builder.build()
except ContainerBuildError as error:
    for issue in error.report.errors:
        print(issue.code, issue.path, issue.message)
```

Independent root failures are aggregated so one build can report several composition mistakes. Issues have a stable code, `error` or `warning` severity, a message, and a semantic component path. Errors always fail the build; warnings are available for policy in tooling and CI.

Current issue codes include:

- `missing-component`, `missing-entrypoint`, and `ambiguous-selection`;
- `circular-dependency` and `captive-dependency`;
- `generic-specialization` and `overlay-singleton`;
- `invalid-argument` and `invalid-derived-argument`;
- `validation-rule-error` for a broken custom validation callback;
- `unreachable-component`.

Applications may add their own stable codes by registering a custom graph rule. These issues use the same report, JSON,
CLI strictness, and warning-suppression behavior as compiler findings. Use `CompiledGraph.walk()` for a deterministic
all-roots traversal; each returned `GraphVisit` retains the component objects and the matching diagnostic path. See
[Custom graph rules](validation.md#custom-graph-rules) for a complete example.

## Render the compiled graph

The graph includes registrations and activation edges for decorators, pre-configurations, default and configured values,
runtime contexts, and declared scope slots. Decorator pipelines render outside-to-inside with their
positions and metadata. Nodes describe components; edges consistently describe their relationship as
`depends on: <argument>`, `decorated by`, or `pre-configured by`.

```python
text = container.graph.to_text()
mermaid = container.graph.to_mermaid()
manifest = container.graph.manifest()

print(manifest.fingerprint)
```

Renderers and manifests show marked entry points by default. Pass `all_roots=True` to inspect every compiled root.
`graph.walk()` is intentionally different: validation traversal always includes every root so an entry-point marker
cannot weaken a policy rule.

The JSON manifest is deterministic across equivalent builds. It uses semantic paths and qualified type names instead of component UUIDs or memory addresses. Fixed values are represented by type and activation kind; their contents are not serialized. Build-argument keys and values are also omitted from manifests, fingerprints, build reports, text output, and Mermaid output. Wiring changes selected by those inputs remain visible in the compiled graph. This makes manifests suitable for review without leaking configured secrets.

```python
from clean_ioc import GraphManifest

baseline = GraphManifest.from_json(saved_json)
difference = container.graph.manifest().diff(baseline)

for change in difference.changed:
    print(change.path)
```

Manifest schema version `1` is validated when loading. A diff reports added, removed, and semantically changed component paths.

## Use it from the command line

Expose a builder, built scope, or zero-argument composition factory from an importable module:

```python
# my_app/composition.py
def application_builder():
    builder = ContainerBuilder()
    builder.register(PaymentGateway, StripeGateway)
    builder.register(Checkout)
    builder.mark_entrypoint(Checkout)
    return builder
```

Then validate, render, and diff it without starting the application:

```bash
clean-ioc check my_app.composition:application_builder
clean-ioc graph my_app.composition:application_builder --format mermaid
clean-ioc graph my_app.composition:application_builder --format json -o dependency-graph.json
clean-ioc diff my_app.composition:application_builder dependency-graph.json
```

`check` exits non-zero for build errors. Warnings are informational by default; `--strict` makes unsuppressed warnings fail, and `--ignore CODE` suppresses a warning code. Errors cannot be ignored.

`diff` exits `0` when the graph is unchanged and `1` when it changed. Add `--all` to `graph` or `diff` when the baseline should include every root rather than the entry-point view. Baselines are never updated implicitly.

Example CI policy:

```yaml
- name: Validate dependency graph
  run: clean-ioc check my_app.composition:application_builder --strict
- name: Detect dependency graph changes
  run: clean-ioc diff my_app.composition:application_builder dependency-graph.json
```

Update the checked-in manifest only after reviewing the corresponding composition change.
